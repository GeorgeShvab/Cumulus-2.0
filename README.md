# Cumulus is your meteorological assistant

For development of this project I used Typescripr, NextJs, WeatherApi and Tailwind.

This project is not big and relatively ease. I have been developing it for learning.

You can run this project locally if you have your own WeatherApi One Call API 3.0 key. Just create env.local nad past your key in OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY.

For the curious, Cumulus is a kind of clouds.

It's name on Github is Cumulus-2.0 because I already have old less advanced project with same name.
