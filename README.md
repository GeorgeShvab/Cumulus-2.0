# Cumulus is my meteorological assistant

For development of this project I used Typescripr, NextJs, WeatherApi and Tailwind.

This project is not big and relatively easy. I've been developing it to learn NextJs.

You can run this project locally if you have your own WeatherApi One Call API 3.0 key. Just create env.local and paste your key in OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY.

For the curious, Cumulus is a kind of cloud.

Its name on Github is Cumulus-2.0 because I already have an old, less advanced project with the same name.

Recently I have done some refactoring and integrated momentjs to get familiar with this library.

Here you can find the deployed app: https://cumulus-2-0.vercel.app
